Ferrite relies on this type of endpoint for rich display of instantly available magnets.\nThe workaround: A user's magnet library now serves as the instant availability cache. There is now a manual Download to Debrid button on the context menu for each search result and bookmark so a user can manually queue a magnet for downloading. If the magnet is instantly available, it'll show the file contents as before and add the magnet to the user's instant availability cache (making the debrid badge green!).\nHere's a picture showing where this new button is located:\n\nAt this time, I do not recommend using RealDebrid or AllDebrid. However, the above workaround makes these services useable.

JSON can still be used, but YAML is the preferred plugin language and JSON is considered to be deprecated.\n- Add the ability to manually refresh library cloud and plugin views\n- Fix searching for some sources that use an API. I over-hardened the scraping system\n- Make search URL request timeouts configurable with the option to disable them if needed. This is helpful for slower networks and if a website gets a large amount of traffic and slows down result fetching.\n- Add about and website options for plugins.

The work focused on reducing project size, splitting large files into smaller modules, and improving maintainability. English \u2194 Spanish translation tasks were also streamlined in this version.\n\nSUMEE is a highly stylized, nostalgic iOS launcher and frontend inspired by the PS Vita interface and the Frutiger Aero design language.\nProject Context (Important)\nThis repository is a refactored Lite fork of the original SUMEE! project, based on my own original codebase.\nTo build SUMEE Lite, I used AI as a development assistant to help reduce and reorganize parts of the original SUMEE! codebase into a smaller, more modular structure.\nMain goal of this fork:\n- Make SUMEE! smaller and easier to maintain.\n- Split large files/features into smaller, modular components.\n- Keep behavior and design identity while improving readability and iteration speed.\nAbout development workflow:\n- Core architecture, app logic, and project direction are authored manually.\n- Refactoring focused on decomposition into reusable pieces (views, managers, and feature modules).\n- English \u2194 Spanish translation tasks were also made easier during this refactor process.\nAI Usage in the Codebase\nAI tools were used as targeted support to speed up refactoring, cleanup, and writing tasks.\nHowever, the project design, core architecture, and technical decisions behind SUMEE! Lite are original work and are maintained manually.\nIt transforms your iOS navigation experience with 3D bubble icons, \"LiveArea\" style app pages, floating cartridges, and a fully functional system interface including Music, Photos, and Game integrations.\nJoin our Discord\nFeatures\n\nVita-Style Home Screen:\nVertical scrolling pages with 3D, physics-based bubble icons.\n\"Wobble\" edit mode and drag-and-drop organization.\n\n\nLiveArea Interface:\nLaunch apps into a \"LiveArea\" gate before entering.\nPeel-to-Close: Use the signature \"peel\" gesture (top-right corner) to close apps and games. Includes haptic feedback!\n\n\nSystem Apps:\nMusic Player: Floating mini-player and full-screen visualization.\nPhotos: Integrated gallery viewer.\nSettings: Comprehensive customization (Lite Mode, Performance Mode, Custom Themes).\n\n\nEmulation Frontend:\nBuilt-in support for launching and managing ROMs (requires appropriate backend/core setup).\n\n\nAesthetics:\nFrutiger Aero gloss and depth.\nDynamic backgrounds and floating particle effects.\nCustom \"Lite Mode\" for older devices to ensure smooth 60fps performance.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nmacOS with the latest version of Xcode (15.0+ recommended).\niOS Device matching the deployment target (iOS 15.0+).\nApple ID (for signing).\n\nGetting Started\n1. Clone the Repository\nbash\ngit clone https://github.com/getzemani63/sumee-lite.git\ncd sumee-lite\n2. Open in Xcode\nDouble-click on SUMEE!.xcodeproj to open the project.\n3. Configure Signing\n\nClick on the SUMEE project icon in the top-left project navigator.\nSelect the SUMEE target under \"Targets\".\nGo to the Signing & Capabilities tab.\nSelect your Team from the dropdown menu.\nEnsure the Bundle Identifier is unique (e.g., change com.sumee.app to com.yourname.sumee) if you don't have access to the original team profile.\n\n4. Run the App\n\nConnect your iOS device via USB.\nSelect your device from the generic device list in the top toolbar.\nPress Cmd + R or click the Play button to build and run.\n\n\nNote: If running on a physical device for the first time, you may need to trust your developer profile in Settings > General > VPN & Device Management on your iPhone/iPad.\n\n\nBuilding an IPA (For Sideloading)\nTo verify the app or share it (e.g., via AltStore, SideStore, or TrollStore), you need to export an .ipa file.\n\n\nSelect \"Any iOS Device (arm64)\":\n\nIn the device selector (top toolbar), choose Any iOS Device (arm64) instead of a specific connected phone.\n\n\n\nArchive:\n\nGo to Product > Archive in the menu bar.\nXcode will build the project. This may take a few minutes.\n\n\n\nDistribute App:\n\nOnce the Organizer window appears with your archive selected, click Distribute App.\nSelect Custom (or Ad Hoc / Development depending on your Xcode version options).\nChoose App Thinning: None (to make it compatible with all devices) or select your specific model.\nSigning: Select Automatically manage signing or manually select your profile.\n\n\n\nExport:\n\nChoose a destination folder on your Mac.\nXcode will generate a folder containing SUMEE.ipa.\n\n\n\nYou can now sideload this SUMEE.ipa using tools like AltServer or SideStore.\nContributing\nContributions are welcome.
