There is now a manual \nDownload to Debrid\n button on the context menu for each search result and bookmark so a user can manually queue a magnet for downloading. If the magnet is instantly available, it'll show the file contents as before and add the magnet to the user's instant availability cache (making the debrid badge green!).\n\n\nHere's a picture showing where this new button is located:\n\n\n\nAt this time, I do not recommend using RealDebrid or AllDebrid.

These include sources, debrid options, debrid cache status, and sorting. The UI is inspired from GitHub's iOS app\n- Fix scope bar not showing up on iOS 16.4 and above\n- Switch plugin system to primarily use the YAML markup language. YAML is more flexible to work with compared to JSON files which can feel rigid. JSON can still be used, but YAML is the preferred plugin language and JSON is considered to be deprecated.\n- Add the ability to manually refresh library cloud and plugin views\n- Fix searching for some sources that use an API. I over-hardened the scraping system\n- Make search URL request timeouts configurable with the option to disable them if needed. This is helpful for slower networks and if a website gets a large amount of traffic and slows down result fetching.\n- Add about and website options for plugins. These supersede the baseURL parameters in sources\n\n\nVersions for 0.7 and up only support iOS 15",

This likely works because you had logged into MuffinStoreJailed or PancakeStore in the past, even on a different device.\n\n\nThe app crashes when I try to downgrade:\n You likely did not purchase (download) the app in the past. Download the app beforehand and remove it, or purchase it from another device. \n\n",
