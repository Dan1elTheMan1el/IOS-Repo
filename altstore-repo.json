There is now a manual `Download to Debrid` button on the context menu for each search result and bookmark so a user can manually queue a magnet for downloading. If the magnet is instantly available, it'll show the file contents as before and add the magnet to the user's instant availability cache (making the debrid badge green!).\r\n\r\nHere's a picture showing where this new button is located:\r\n![Simulator Screenshot - iPhone 16 Pro - 2024-11-27 at 23 24 38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85735a40-2a4b-4aea-bbfa-b0ba0049b3ec)\r\n\r\nAt this time, I do not recommend using RealDebrid or AllDebrid.

The UI is inspired from GitHub's iOS app\r\n- Fix scope bar not showing up on iOS 16.4 and above\r\n- Switch plugin system to primarily use the YAML markup language. YAML is more flexible to work with compared to JSON files which can feel rigid. JSON can still be used, but YAML is the preferred plugin language and JSON is considered to be deprecated.\r\n- Add the ability to manually refresh library cloud and plugin views\r\n- Fix searching for some sources that use an API. I over-hardened the scraping system\r\n- Make search URL request timeouts configurable with the option to disable them if needed. This is helpful for slower networks and if a website gets a large amount of traffic and slows down result fetching.\r\n- Add about and website options for plugins. These supersede the baseURL parameters in sources\r\n\r\n**Versions for 0.7 and up only support iOS 15**",

The application you want to downgrade will need to be uninstalled. If you want to keep the app data, offload the app first.\n2. Install PancakeStore using your preferred sideloading method.\n3. Log in your Apple ID, and click \"Send 2FA Code.\" If you can, try sending a 2FA code before logging in (there should be this in the settings app, but it was removed in iOS 18?).\n4. In most cases, you should get a popup. Accept the new login, and copy the verification code into the 2FA field. If you don't get that popup, type six random numbers into the 2FA field. I assume this works because you must've logged into MuffinStoreJailed/PancakeStore at a different time. \n5. Click \"log in\" and go to the App Store.\n6.
